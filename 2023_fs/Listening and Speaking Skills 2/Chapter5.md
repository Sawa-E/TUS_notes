Just listen for keywords and concepts while trying to follow the basic ideas that are being discussed. Charles Dickens was born in Portsmouth, England, in 12th, the second of eight children. His father held various positions, and young Charles had lived in three different homes by the time he was four. Unfortunately, his father also had a habit of living beyond his means, which eventually landed him in debtors prison in 1824. Her. As was standard at that time, charles mother and younger siblings joined his father in prison. This separated Charles, who was twelve, from the rest of his family in.He initially moved in with an old family friend and then eventually relocated to a small room in the house of an agent for the court. To pay for his room and board and to help his family, charles quit school and began to work ten hour days at a factory. He spent long hours in a small court corner of one of the factory's rooms, where he used paper to cover pots that would be used to store boot blacking. The work was boring and exhausting, and it had a lasting effect on the young Charles. After a few months of this bleak lifestyle, charles grandmother passed away and left his family with a small inheritance. His father used the money to pay off his debts and his family was released from prison. Unfortunately, his mother had come to enjoy the additional income that Charles was earning, so she sent him back to work for a short while. Charles was deeply hurt and angered by his mother's decision and this created in him a lifelong distrust of women. Dickens powerful memory of these significant events and people in his early life provided him with much of the material that he would later use in his novels. After a brief but successful career as a political journalist he was contacted by a publisher to write monthly installments of stories designed to match a series of illustrations. The resulting work, The Pickwick Papers, was a huge success and he followed that up by writing a serial novel titled Oliver Twist which was the first Victorian novel to have a child protagonist. Dickens incredible work ethic saw him publish numerous novels, essays and letters give numerous public readings of his works, campaign for the rights of children, and promote social reforms. He was a gift gifted, deeply sensitive writer whose works have been enjoyed by countless readers.
